## Tutorials

### How I build this site. 

I built this site using Rmarkdown. There are many awesome tools to help build an awesome personal website in [Github](https://github.com) (Such as R's [blogdown](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/)). I was specifically looking for tools to build a personal website with the following considerations:

1. Simple: All I needed was to display some information on a static website. I was not planning on writing blogs.

2. Automated: such as being able to pull information from my google scholar page.

3. Easy to use.

I ended up building this site using Rstudio, inspired by [this tutorial](https://github.com/privefl/rmarkdown-website-template).
