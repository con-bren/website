<br>


#### 3. Dartmouth's tutorial on fMRI analyses using Python 

Course Overview: "The goal of the class is to introduce: (1) how the scanner generates data, (2) how psychological states can be probed in the scanner, and (3) how this data can be processed and analyzed. Students will be expected to analyze brain imaging data using the opensource Python programming language. We will be using several packages such as numpy, matplotlib, nibabel, nilearn, fmriprep, and nltools. This course will be useful for students working in neuroimaging labs, completing a neuroimaging thesis, or interested in pursuing graduate training in fields related to cognitive neuroscience."

[Link](https://dartbrains.org/content/intro.html)

For example, they have a chapter on PPI analysis using nilearn pipelines [here](https://dartbrains.org/content/Connectivity.html).

### Other

#### 1. Friendly Universe
<br>
![](files/images/fun.png){width=350px}

Friendly Universe is a Qualtrics survey template to anonymously measure the structure of individuals' social networks. Friendly Universe measures the nodes and edges of the network, as well as the group (i.e. family, friends), and the emotional closeness of each node. This tool is easy to use and can be custromized through Qualtrics and Javascript.

#### 3. How I build this site. 

I built this site using Rmarkdown. I was specifically looking for tools to build a personal website with the following considerations:

1. Simple: All I needed was to display some information on a static website. I was not planning on writing blogs.

2. Automated: such as being able to pull information from my google scholar page.

3. Easy to use.

I ended up building this site using Rstudio, inspired by [this tutorial](https://github.com/privefl/rmarkdown-website-template).
