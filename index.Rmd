__What am I up to?__<br>
I am currently super excited to virtually attend ICA20! You can watch my talk on "Neural processes associated with habitual and emotional Facebook use" [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xup4nB9zZT0&t=14s).

<div class="column-right">
I am a Ph.D candidate at the Annenberg School for Communication at University of Pennsylvania. I completed a B.Sc of Cognitive Neuroscience at Brown University. 
<br>

I'm interested in combining developmental neuroscience and communication research to promote healthy behavior in adolescents and young adults.
